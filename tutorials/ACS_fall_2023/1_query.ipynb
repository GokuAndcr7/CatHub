    "# CatHub Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is developed in connection to the SUNCAT Summer Institute 2023. The CatHub code is a Python API to access the Surface Reactions database on [Catalysis-Hub.org](http://www.catalysis-hub.org). The module includes a command line interface (in your terminal) as well as a Python interface to access and upload data. In this tutorial you will learn how to access catalysis-hub.org data via the Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing cathub\n",
    "To install CatHub use pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install git+https://github.com/SUNCAT-Center/CatHub.git --upgrade --user\n",
    "\n",
    "which will install CatHub and all their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Postgres</b> is also a dependency, and you might need to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ brew install postgresql (on mac)\n",
    "$ sudo apt install postgresql (on ubuntu) \n",
    "\n",
    "To test that the cathub cli is working, start by typing in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ cathub --help\n",
    "\n",
    "and you should see a list of subcommands. If itâ€™s not working you probably have to add the installation path to PATH in your `~/.bashrc`. This would typically be `export PATH=~/.local/bin:${PATH}` for Linux, and `export PATH~/Library/PythonX.Y/bin:${PATH}` for Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tutorial as a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial files (`.ipynb` extension) can be executedn as jypyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install jupyter run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install jypyter\n",
    "\n",
    "and open this demonstration as: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ jupyter notebook 1_query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can copy the code blocks below into a `.py` text file and execute in python. To save time, please avoid excecuting the same query to the server again and again by commenting out `get_dataframe()` line after running once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo 1: Querying adsorption energetics from Catalysis-hub\n",
    "In this demonstration you will learn how to fetch adsorption energies from Catalysis-hub.org\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by familiarizing yourself with the datasets on the main webpage http://www.catalysis-hub.org/publications\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is divided into distinct datasets, usually belonging to a particular publication. A dataset is queried based on the \"pub_id\"  which is a a unique dataset id constructed from title, first author name and publication year. In this example we will start by using our recent dataset https://www.catalysis-hub.org/publications/SainiElectronic2022, publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00846-z\n",
    "\n",

    "### Fetching data in Python\n",
    "To connect to the catalysis-hub.org server in your Python script, start by importing the cathub SQL interface and create a database connection to the catalysis-hub server:"
