## CatHub Tutorial

This tutorial is developed in connection to the ACS Fall 2022 Symposium "Open-Source Software for Kinetics, Chemical Networks, & Reactor Modeling".  CatHub provides an interface to the Surface Reactions database on [Catalysis-Hub.org](http://www.catalysis-hub.org). The module includes a command line interface (in your terminal) as well as a Python interface to access and upload data. In this tutorial you will learn how to access catalysis-hub.org data via the Python interface.


# Installing cathub
To install CatHub use pip:

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/SUNCAT-Center/CatHub.git --upgrade --user

which will install CatHub and all their dependencies.

To test that the cathub cli is working, start by typing in your terminal:

    $ cathub --help

and you should see a list of subcommands. If itâ€™s not working you probably have to add the installation path to PATH in your `~/.bashrc`. This would typically be `export PATH=~/.local/bin:${PATH}` for Linux, and `export PATH~/Library/PythonX.Y/bin:${PATH}` for Mac.

# Catalysis-hub background info
Familiarize yourself with the datasets on the Catalysis-hub webpage http://www.catalysis-hub.org/publications

Data is divided into distinct datasets belonging to a particular publication, that can be queries based on the "pub_id"  a unique dataset id constructed from title, first author name and publication year.

# Exercise 1: Scaling relations
Here you will learn how to fetch adsorption energies and plot scaling relations in python. We will use the example of O vs OH scaling from our 2022 transition metal oxides dataset https://www.catalysis-hub.org/publications/ComerUnraveling2022 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c02381


To connect to the catalysis-hub.org server in your script, start by importing the cathub SQL interface

    from cathub.cathubsql import CathubSQL
    db = CathubSQL()

Then use the `get_dataframe()` method to query adsorption energy data into a pandas dataframe:

    dataframe = db.get_dataframe(pub_id='ComerUnraveling2022')
    print(dataframe)

Inspect the dataframe by printing it to your terminal. Syntax for the pandas is found [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/03_subset_data.html#min-tut-03-subset). Main columns consists of the chemicalComposition (chemical formula of the total slab), surface_composition (reduced chemical composition, with surface specific tags), equation (equation for the reaction), reaction_energy.

To continue the analysis, please save the dataframe into a pickle file on your local workspace:

    dataframe.to_pickle('ComerUnraveling2022.pickle')

Now you can examine the your local file without pulling from the server:

    # db = CathubSQL()
    # dataframe = db.get_dataframe(pub_id='ComerUnraveling2022')
    # dataframe.to_pickle('ComerUnraveling2022.pickle')

    dataframe = pandas.read_pickle('ComerUnraveling2022.pickle')

Now, use your favorite python plotting module to plot the OH vs. O scaling (i.e. plotting OH vs O adsorption energies) Start by examining the unique chemical reactions and facets for the dataset, for example:

    print(dataframe["equation"].unique().tolist()) # Unique reactions
    print(dataframe["facet"].unique().tolist()) # unique facets


Using matplotlib/pylab you can plot the scaling relation like this:

    import pylab as p

    O_110 = dataframe[(dataframe["equation"] =='H2O(g) - H2(g) + * -> O*') & (dataframe['facet']=='110')]
    OH_110 = dataframe[(dataframe["equation"] =='H2O(g) - 0.5H2(g) + * -> HO*' ) &(dataframe['facet']=='110')]
    dataframe_together = O_110.merge(OH_110, on='surface_composition',
                                      suffixes=('_O', '_OH'))

    x_data = dataframe_together['reaction_energy_OH']
    y_data = dataframe_together['reaction_energy_OH']
    p.scatter(x_data, y_data)
    for i, txt in enumerate(dataframe_together['surface_composition']):
      p.gca().annotate(txt,
        (x_data[i],
         y_data[i]))
    p.title('O-OH Scaling relation')
    p.show()


Now try to repeat the plot choosing another facet from the dataset.

## Exercise 1 challenge:

Plot the scaling relationship for another dataset of your choice.

# Exercise 2: Atomic structures

Examine atomic structures via different routes:
- Python
- cathub ase gui

Use the Python interface to query atomic structure for a dataset of choice. (Please choose a smaller dataset with Nreactions < 500) to save time)

    from cathub.cathubsql import CathubSQL
    from ase.visualize import view

    db = CathubSQL()
    atoms_list = db.get_atoms_for_publication(pub_id='ComerUnraveling2022')

    view(atoms_list)

You should now see ase gui open with several atomic structures.

Also try to write you atoms to a local ase db:

  db = CathubSQL()
  atoms_list = db.get_atoms_for_publication(pub_id='ComerUnraveling2022')

  dblocal = connect('ComerUnraveling2022.db')
  for atoms in atoms_list:
      dblocal.write(atoms)

and inspect your db with the ase from the command line:

    $ ase db ComerUnraveling2022.db
    $ ase gui ComerUnraveling2022.db

Next, try to query structures into the pandas dataframe where atomic structures and reaction energies are connected.


    db = CathubSQL()
    dataframe = db.get_dataframe(pub_id='ComerUnraveling2022',
                                 include_atoms=True)
    dataframe.to_pickle('ComerUnraveling2022_with_atoms.pickle')


and next, view atoms for a specific reaction row by choosing a reaction row in the script below. Atoms objects include empty surface, surface with adsorbate, gas phase molecules and bulk geometry.

    dataframe = pandas.read_pickle('ComerUnraveling2022_with_atoms.pickle')
    print(dataframe[['chemical_composition', 'equation', 'atoms_name']])
    view(dataframe['atoms']["row_id"])

Notice that the "atoms_name" column contain names of geometries, to query only OH adsorption geometries, try this:

    atoms_list_OH = []
    for id, row in dataframe.iterrows():
        if not 'HOstar' in row['atoms_name']:
            continue
        index = row['atoms_name'].index('HOstar')
        atoms_list_O += [row['atoms'][index]]

    view(atoms_list_OH)
